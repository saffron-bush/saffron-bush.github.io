    <P>
        So this week has been a heap of trial and error. And boy it can be exhausting. To break up the chaos in my brain, I went for a drive. As I was driving, a classical guitar piece came on the radio. For those who want to follow, the piece was Recuerdos de la Alhambra played by John Williams (love that it sounds like a consistent note being played, but, it is 3 strings being plucked in very quick succession). It got me thinking…classical music is so much like coding and the journey of solving problems. 
    </P>

    <ul>
      <li> The hopeful beginning - You have your quiet entry into the problem/piece of music. You are hopeful that it is going to be soothing and enjoyable</li>
      <li> The slow build - The tension starts to build and you start thinking “where is this going? Are they in control? Am I in control? Is this piece as simple as I first thought?”</li>
      <li>The calm before the storm - You hear your first note that sounds like it is out of place, and you question “should it be there? Is this heading in the right direction?”</li>
      <li>The crashing of cymbals - Then the Violence starts, its a back and forth of notes/code that completely consume you and you are thinking “I don't think I like this anymore, why did I put myself through this?</li>
      <li>The Lullaby - You then get your first break through in the code and the music becomes a soothing lullaby. You think to yourself, “I got this, nothing to worry about.”</li>
      <li>Reaching the pinnacle - Then the music intensifies again and the panic of how to finish the code. Your desire for it to look and feel elegant, hits you with a wave of anxiety.  Chaos and slight panic ensues. You think, 'I got this far, c'mon man pull it together'</li>
      <li>The Euphoria - You finally solve the problem (well you think you have solved it) and there is a sense of elation. You think “I can do this, I can be a coder” and your subconscious is screaming “well heck that was a journey…” </li>
      </li>
    </ul>

    

    <p> 
      Okay, so how do you deal with the crashing of the symbols moment? How can you reduce the noise and amplify the problem solving. What can you do to reach that lullaby? And eventually Euphoria? Well as mentioned before, everything is a learnable skill so let's talk through how I did that this week.
    <p>

    <p>
      This week was what I am going to call the “take everything you have already learnt and stretch your problem solving skills in JavaScript til your brain hurts” week. It was a bunch of challenges, where I was flipping through my notes every 1 minute to understand what was being asked. There were countless panic, anxiety and 'C'mon man pull it together' moments.
    </P>
    <p>
      The challenge this week was kata. Kata is a bunch of challenges that build  on your knowledge. They described it as: <em>'small, repetitive tasks used to improve your form. We use kata in coding as small challenges that we can do again and again to use different techniques, different pieces of code, to try and solve the same problem in different ways'.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      In each Kata they generally throw you the first 2 questions for free. They want to make sure you are awake (aka the hopeful beginning).  Then the music increases for question 3. This week I started on the Gradebook challenge. It is a set of 2 arrays (students and scores) that you want to push the data together with functions to pull both those arrays' data together. What started off as quite simple, became a little noisier. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Before you start coding you need to think about how you might approach the problem. You need to figure out all the information you have and figure out how you are going to get it to where you want to to be. 
    </p>

    <p span style="color: #82adfc">Trying Something</span></p>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>Take a problem</li>
        <li>Break down into smaller parts</li>
        <li>Begin building your way towards a solution</li>
        <li>Something my facilitator said to me was, start with your inputs and outputs. Then figure out how you are going to get from your input to your output.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      I realised my first attempt at the question was not what they were asking. I re-read the questions again and then wrote out my own set of instructions. 
    </p>

    <p span style="color: #82adfc">Pseudocode</span></p>

    <p>
      Writing out your instructions with // at the beginning is called pseudocode. Pseudocode is just any representation of code that isn't actually code. There is no specific syntax for pseudocode, it literally can be anything you want. So for example, while I might say the following in code…
    </p>

    <p>
      for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++) { <br>
        console.log(i); <br>
      }<br>    
    </p>

    <P>
      We could also express it in more human readable pseudocode.<br><br>
      <em>loop from 0 to 10</em><br>
      <em>console.log loop index</em><br>
    </P>

    <p>
      Pseudocode in steps:
    </p>

    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>Take time to familiarize yourself with the problem</li>
        <li>Break down into small steps </li>
        <li>Focus on each of those individual steps - (this allows you to focus on one thing at a time and also helps if you are working on the problem with others. They get a sense of what you are trying to achieve.)</li>
        <li>Start building your steps. Pseudocode is steps rather than code. You want to include just the general steps rather than the specific detail.</li>
        <li>relook at order, does anything need to change before you can move forward? Eg do you need to change the order of one of the steps? Or did you miss a step?</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      However, no matter what I wrote or how much I wrote I still could not solve the problem. So I moved on to the coder's best friend..
    </p>

    <p span style="color: #82adfc">Google</span></p>

    <p>
      I tend to find videos on youtube help me the most. When I read a set of words, my brain starts to purge them immediately even when I am concentrating like crazy. Whereas watching someone speak about that concept, with diagrams etc, helps me retain the information better. (Turns out this course has taught me I am a visual learner). The thing about JavaScript, is the language seems to be pretty boundless. So what someone may write about or explain in a youtube video, may not solve the problem in front of you. It can just provide more cushioning to ground the concepts within the problem. So where to next?....
    </p>

    <p span style="color: #82adfc">Asking my facilitator</span></p>

    <p>
      We are really lucky at DevAcademy that we each get someone to support us who has done the course before. They have been through the trials and tribulations of learning to code and understand how intense the DevAcademu course is. My facilitator Sophia had no previous coding knowledge before DevAcademy (just like me). She also found it really difficult (just like me). She was also once a caterpillar who has become a coding butterfly. She is now helping other students move their way towards becoming coding butterflies. So, in my hour of need, I messaged my facilitator. I asked what else I should be thinking about when looking at that particular question. What was i missing? What other concepts had I not grounded yet? And I waited…
    </p>

    <p span style="color: #82adfc">Rubber Ducky (my Teapot)</span></p>

    <p>
      If you have worked in software before, you would have noticed a few rubber ducks on developers desks. Why the rubber duck? What is its significance? It turns out, you just need to explain the problem out loud to get your brain in problem-solving mode. Rather than bugging someone else (sorry Sophia), you just bug the rubber duck on your desk (or in my case the teapot on my desk). 
    </p>
    <p>
      To do this, you start by saying what you are trying to achieve and how you are trying to solve it.This requires you to use your own language to explain what you are asking the computer to do. Using these 3 different perspectives: yourself (the programmer), the person you are explaining it to (rubber ducky), and then putting your computer in the narrative (the machine), should help you to understand where you could be going wrong.
    </p>

    <P>
      So as I was waiting to hear back from my facilitator, I started saying the problem out loud. I have to say, It feels silly talking to a teapot, but it works. Voilà as I was talking out loud, I realised my mistake. What I was trying to do on multiple lines, I could just concatenate to reach my answer. Euphoria!!!
    </P>

    <P>
      The above explained one of the many experiences I went through this week but what are some other methods you can use for problem solving?
    </P>

    <p span style="color: #82adfc">Reading error messages</span></p>

    <P>
      Reading error messages can seem like a bunch of jargon when first starting out. They can be breadcrumbs to what is wrong in your code. They can tell you: </P>
      <ul>
      <li>which line is breaking the code.</li>
      <li>Additionally, it spits out different error messages to help you debug what might be wrong.</li>
      </ul> 
      <p>Albeit, since I am just a beginner, many of those error messages just seem like gibberish. Slowly over time, some of these keywords will start to mean more. So far this has been really helpful for syntax errors in my code. Telling me I am missing a comma or a bracket. Additionally, you can also google that error message when it pops up  to understand it in further detail.
    </P>
  
    <p span style="color: #82adfc">Console.logging</span></p>

    <p>
      Is a proactive tool to help troubleshoot your code as you are building it. It becomes really useful when debugging your Javascript. Let's say you have a heap of code and you are unsure what a variable's  value is. What it has been assigned and where it is being executed. By console.logging you can name the variable and ask the console what is its current value. In the Console it will then show you the value attached to that variable and the line the console.log was executed. 
    </p>

    <p span style="color: #82adfc">Asking your peers for help</span></p>

    <p>
      Last week I got some help from a wonderful peer in the course (thank you Louisa). She was so incredibly helpful. IMO she has managed to pick up JavaScript concepts really well (much better than I). By asking for help she was able to empathize with the struggle in that particular exercise. She also explained what else she thought about as she was trying to solve the problem. She said things like: “have you sussed out how to get that count? it's definitely something you've already used before in the earlier js challenges” giving me hints but also directing me to reflect on what I had learnt before. 
    </p>

    <p span style="color: #82adfc">Improving your process with reflection</span></p>

    <p>
      After you finish solving a problem, the last thing you want to do is keep looking at that problem, right? Well no, this is actually a really smart way to keep locking in those concepts and learnings. This agile method helps to build tools for sustainable development. Driving consistency in your learnings. It is about reflecting on what you did right, but also what you did wrong and using that as lessons for future builds. A method you could use is the 4 L's. The 4Ls stands for Liked, Learned, Lacked and Longed For. What did you like about what you executed? What did you learn about coding or yourself? What did you lack during the process? (knowledge, grit, breaks?), what did you long for during the process? (speed, accuracy, beautiful execution0. This helps you to build a framework of what you are doing well but also what do you need to work better at? What should your goals be for next time you start with a challenge? How do you make sure you are continuously improving?
      </p>

    <p>As you know, <span style="font-size: 20px">Everything is a Learnable Skill.</span> so all of the above problem solving techniques I will keep up my sleeve. As I hit those moments of crashing cymbals, I will  continue to think outside of the Bachs and hopefully eventually hit Euphoria. 

    </p>
