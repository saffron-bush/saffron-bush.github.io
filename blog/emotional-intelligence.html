       <p> I once had a friend say to her mum "I don't need to keep going to school, I will just use street smarts like Saffron"
        I was honored but also a little perplexed, what did she mean by street smarts? and if I was street smart what was book smarts?</p>

        <p>Book smarts or what you would call <span style="color: #82adfc">IQ, stands for Intelligent quotient.
        It is a measure of a person's reasoning ability.</span>
        It is used to gauge how well someone can use information and logic to answer questions or make predictions. 
        IQ focusses on:
        <ul>
        <li>Measuring long and short term memory</li>
        <li>Knowledge of the world</li>
        <li>Fluid reasoning</li>
        <li>Quantitative reasoning</li>
        <li>Visual and spatial processing</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

       <p> So if that is IQ (book smarts), then what is street smarts?
        Well it turns out there is a different part of your brain that processes a different type of intelligence. 
       That intelligence is called: <span style="color: #82adfc">Emotional Intelligence. 
        EQ can be defined as how well we perceive, evaluate and express emotions both with ourselves and within our relationships with others.</span> 
        People with high EQ know what they're feeling, what their emotions mean and how those emotions can affect other people. 
        You then use this awareness to guide your decisions in any situation.</p>

        Self awareness- knowing what we are feeling and why we are feeling. 
        It creates good intuition and decision making and a good moral compass. 
        Keeping a journal helps this. Also slowing down when you experience strong emotions to examine why.
        
        Self regulation - handling your distressing emotions in effective ways. 
        Tuning into them when needed as every emotion has a function. 
        
        Mastering positive emotions - Aligning actions with passion
        Know your values, Hold yourself accountable (admit your mistakes), practice being calm
        
        Motivation -  Mastering positive emotions - Aligning actions with passion. 
        Having extremely high standards for the quality of your work.
        Re-examine why you are doing  what your job/study (set goals), know where you stand - if you are feeling unmotivated own it and work on it,  be hopeful and find something good - try to find atleast one good thing about the situation.
        
        Empathy - knowing what someone else is feeling
        Put yourself in someone else's position, pay attention to body language, respond to feelings (when you hear disappointment notice that and respond)
        Skilled relationship - putting that all together. Be open to hearing both good and bad news. You become good at amanging change and resolving conflict diplomatically.
        Learn conflict resolution, Imrove your communication skills, learn how to praise others.



Neuroplasticity - shapes brains long term. So learning the above will shape your brain in a positive way. Not only do you benefit by listenintg to youself but it also helps you to become more in tune with others. 

Research shows when doing this:
Antisocial behavior goes down
Prosocial behavior goes up
Academic skills go up

Fact: Interestingly, as environments have become more information rich and sophisticated over the past 100 years, 
        IQ results have dramatically been going up.
