       <p> ♥ Happy Galentines day peeps ♥</p>
       <p> Speaking of gal friends, I once had a friend say to her mum "I don't need to keep going to high school, I will just use street smarts like Saffron"
        I was honored but also a little perplexed. What did she mean by street smarts? and if I was street smart, what was book smarts?</p>

        <p>Book smarts or what you would call <span style="color: #82adfc">IQ, stands for Intelligent quotient and
        is a measure of a person's reasoning ability.</span>
        It is used to gauge how well someone can use information and logic to answer questions or make predictions. 
        IQ focusses on:
        <ul>
        <li>Measuring long and short term memory</li>
        <li>Knowledge of the world</li>
        <li>Fluid reasoning</li>
        <li>Quantitative reasoning</li>
        <li>Visual and spatial processing</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

       <p> So if that is IQ (book smarts), then what is street smarts?
       That intelligence is called <span style="color: #82adfc">Emotional Intelligence, 
        EQ can be defined as how well we perceive, evaluate and express emotions both with ourselves and in our relationships with others.</span> 
        People with high EQ know what they're feeling, what their emotions mean and how those emotions can affect other people. 
        EQ is a learned skill just like everything else and to cultivate this you need to: 
        train your body to become more aware of the mind to cultivate a clear, calm and alert mind (aka Attention Training).
        Become more attentive to yourself (aka Practicing Self-Knowledge and Self-Mastery) 
        and develop habits to defend against our critical mind when it arises (aka Creating Useful Mental Habits). 
        </p>

        <p>So had I mastered those skills when my friend mentioned street smarts?...I doubt it. 
            Daniel Goldman talks about 5 parts to EQ and how you can start mastering these skills: 
            <ol>
        <li>Self awareness- knowing what we are feeling and why we are feeling that way. 
        By tapping into this it creates good intuition and decision making and a good moral compass. <em>How to develop this skill? 
        Keep a journal. 
        Slow down when you experience strong emotions to examine yourself in that moment without self criticism</em></li>
        
        <li>Self regulation - handling your distressing emotions in effective ways. <em>How to develop this skill? 
        Tune into these emotions when needed.
        Know your values. Hold yourself accountable (admit your mistakes). Practice being calm </em></li>
        
        <li>Motivation -  Mastering positive emotions - Aligning actions with passion. <em>How to develop this skill? 
        Have high standards for the quality of your work.
        Re-examine why you are doing your job/study (set goals), 
        know where you stand - if you are feeling unmotivated own it and work on it.  
        Be hopeful and find something good - try to find at least one good thing about the situation</li></em>
        
        <li>Empathy - knowing what someone else is feeling.<em>How to develop this skill?
        Put yourself in someone else's position. Pay attention to body language. 
        Respond to feelings (when you hear disappointment notice that and respond). Use active listening.</li></em>
        
        
        <li>Skilled relationship - Be open to hearing both good and bad news. 
        Become a master in giving and receiving support and getting buy-in from others
        By doing this, you become good at managing change and resolving conflict diplomatically.<em>How to develop this skill?
        Learn conflict resolution. Improve your communication skills. Learn how to praise others.</li></em>
        </ol>
        </p>



        <p>Neuroplasticity - is the belief that your brain is always growing and changing with each experience you have. 
            Repeated tasks then solidifies this as a behaviour and shapes our brains long term. 
            In other words, the more we practice the above, the easier it will be ingrained into our everyday behaviour.
            Shaping your brain in a positive way to become in tune with yourself and others.</p>

        <p>Research shows that by doing this:
            <ul>
                <li>Antisocial behavior goes down</li>
                <li>Prosocial behavior goes up</li>
                <li>Academic skills and performance go up</li>
                <li>Those in leadership positions perform much higher</li>
                <li>and there is an increased sense of Happiness</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

        <p>so was my friend right? Should we all just quit school and just become street smart? 
            Nah, there is still a place for book smarts (especially wth learning to code) 
            So as I increase my IQ through this journey, I will also be working on my EQ because... <span style="font-size: 20px">Everything is a Learnable Skill.</span>
