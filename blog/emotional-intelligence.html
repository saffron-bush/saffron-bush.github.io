       <p> I once had a friend say to her mum "I don't need to keep going to school, I will just use street smarts like Saffron"
        I was honored but also a little perplexed, what did she mean by street smarts? and if I was street smart, what was book smarts?</p>

        <p>Book smarts or what you would call <span style="color: #82adfc">IQ, stands for Intelligent quotient and
        is a measure of a person's reasoning ability.</span>
        It is used to gauge how well someone can use information and logic to answer questions or make predictions. 
        IQ focusses on:
        <ul>
        <li>Measuring long and short term memory</li>
        <li>Knowledge of the world</li>
        <li>Fluid reasoning</li>
        <li>Quantitative reasoning</li>
        <li>Visual and spatial processing</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

       <p> So if that is IQ (book smarts), then what is street smarts?
        Well there is a different part of your brain that processes a different type of intelligence. 
       That intelligence is called <span style="color: #82adfc">Emotional Intelligence, 
        EQ can be defined as how well we perceive, evaluate and express emotions both with ourselves and in our relationships with others.</span> 
        People with high EQ know what they're feeling, what their emotions mean and how those emotions can affect other people. 
        To cultivate this you need to do: Attention Training - 
        this is where you are training our body to become more aware of the mind to cultivate a clear, calm and alert mind.
        Practicing Self-Knowledge and Self Mastery - by becoming more attentive to yourself and creating useful mental habits 
        - develop habits to defend against our critical mind when it comes up. 
        </p>

        <p>There are 5 parts to EQ: 
            <ol>
        <li>Self awareness- knowing what we are feeling and why we are feeling that way. 
        By tapping into this it creates good intuition and decision making and a good moral compass.</p>
        <p><em>How to develop this skill? 
        Keep a journal. 
        Slow down when you experience strong emotions to examine yourself in that moment without self criticism</em></li></p>
        
        <li>Self regulation - handling your distressing emotions in effective ways. 
        <p><em>How to develop this skill? 
        Tune into these emotions when needed.
        Know your values. Hold yourself accountable (admit your mistakes). Practice being calm </em></li></p>
        
        <li>Motivation -  Mastering positive emotions - Aligning actions with passion. 
        <p><em>How to develop this skill? 
        Have high standards for the quality of your work.
        Re-examine why you are doing your job/study (set goals), 
        know where you stand - if you are feeling unmotivated own it and work on it.  
        Be hopeful and find something good - try to find at least one good thing about the situation</li></em></p>
        
        <li>Empathy - knowing what someone else is feeling.
        <p><em>How to develop this skill?
        Put yourself in someone else's position. Pay attention to body language. 
        Respond to feelings (when you hear disappointment notice that and respond). Use active listening.</li></em></p>
        
        
        <li>Skilled relationship - Be open to hearing both good and bad news. 
        Become a master in giving and receiving support and getting buy-in from others
        By doing this, you become good at managing change and resolving conflict diplomatically.
        <p><em>How to develop this skill?
        Learn conflict resolution. Improve your communication skills. Learn how to praise others.</li></em></p>
        </ol>
        </p>



Neuroplasticity - shapes brains long term. So learning the above will shape your brain in a positive way. Not only do you benefit by listenintg to youself but it also helps you to become more in tune with others. 

Research shows when doing this:
Antisocial behavior goes down
Prosocial behavior goes up
Academic skills go up

Fact: Interestingly, as environments have become more information rich and sophisticated over the past 100 years, 
        IQ results have dramatically been going up.
