        <h2>How to use Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset to help on your learning journey</h2>
        <h3 style="text-align: left">21 February 2022</h3>
    </div>

    <P>
        In my previous blog post <em>From a caterpillar to a butterfly</em> I explained my commitment to become a coding
        butterfly.
        Now I want to talk about 'success' vs 'failure' and how to reframe this within your learning journey.
        Did you know we can change the meaning of the words 'effort' and 'difficulty'?
        We have the ability to transform these words from having a negative connotation to having positive connotations.
        This is through the use of the below concepts of Neuroplastic brains and using a Growth Mindset.
        'Effort' and 'difficulty' can mean - that our neurons are making more connections resulting in building
        capability (aka getting smarter).
        Focussing away from the end goal and moving towards incremental growth,
        helps to build persistent stamina when learning new skills.
        If the butterfly blog was about the what I need to be conscious of to reach my goals,
        this is about about how I am going to keep up my learning stamina through Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset.
    </P>

    <p span style="color: #82adfc">Neuroplasticity</span></p>

    <p> Neuroplasticity is defined as: The brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections
        throughout life.
        Neuroplasticity allows the neurons (nerve cells) in the brain to compensate for injury and disease
        and to adjust their activities in response to new situations or to changes in their environment.
    <p>

    <p>No longer do people think that brains are hard wired.
        Brains are malleable plastic that is constantly being reshaped through experiences.
        With this in mind, science reveals that how we feel about our ability to succeed or fail, hugely influences our
        outcome. </P>
    <p>
        I love this quote: “Practice makes permanent".
        It is saying that the more times your neural network is stimulated,
        the stronger and more efficient it becomes.
        Practice helps to build super healthy and strong pathways in your brain.
        By doing this it becomes faster and easier to process information on a particular topic.
    </p>

    <p>
        So how can this relate to coding?
        Well every language I learn I am going to need to build new neural pathways.
        Last week was JavaScript week.
        At this stage I think my neural pathway is a thin thread resembling a limp and greasy hair strand.
        What I am saying is, It is has been a steep learning curve.
        Over the coming weeks,months/years my routine will be coming back to the fundamentals.
        Learn, Code, Rinse, Repeat - learning it from different angles and different learning tools.
        Slowly Javascript should build stronger pathways within my brain becoming a full luscious head of hair on (in)
        my head.
    </p>

    <p>
        For those who are also learning new skills, follow these practices to make your brain malleable:
    </p>

    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Practice, Practice, Practice -
            Repeating an activity and reviewing it in a variety of ways helps build thicker, stronger, more hard wired
            connections.
        </li>
        <li>
            Put information in context -
            Prioritise activities that already have existing pathways.
            Find relationships with already existing learned material to help you to learn new ideas/concepts.
        </li>

        <li>
            Be conscious of how the brain works - Continue to believe that intelligence is not an innate skill.
            It is something you have to continually work at through study and review.
            You can literally change your brains structure and this is very empowering as a learner.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

        I found this article interesting which talks about neuroplasticity and coding.
        It also introduced a new concept called spacing.
        Essentially incrementally increasing the time you are learning something over a period time.
        As it has been found that the concept of forgetting something and then trying hard to retrieve it,
        builds really good muscle memory within your brain.

    <p span style="color: #82adfc">Growth Mindset</span></p>

    <P>
        Carol Dweck a pioneer researcher in the field of motivation.
        Her study has been focussed on why people succeed (or don't) and how to foster success. Her definition: In a
        growth mindset,
        people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work—brains
        and talent are just the starting point.
        This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment.”
        Through a number of experiments with students,
        she found that the process of believing that you can learn anything over time, builds better results and
        resilience.
        This is because they worry less about looking smart or getting it right and instead they put more energy into
        learning.
    </P>

    <p>
        Going back to Javascript week.
        By the end of last week, that little voice had started telling me that I would never be good at Javascript.
        Having moments like this are normal.
        However, combatting these moments with Carols Dweck's Growth Mindset concept are important.
        This morning I listened to the Growth mindset video,
        It helped me to reset my frame of mind.
        To believe it just requires a lot of practice and if it is hard, then it is working.
    </p>

    <p>
        For those who are also learning, this is what I have learnt to foster a Growth Mindset:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Do not just focus on the results -
            Be proud of in trying to execute different strategies or pushing myself to put lots of effort into learning
            something.</li>
        <li>Not Yet - Keep telling myself 'not yet' when I don't get it right.
            Rather than focussing that it is impossible.</li>
        <li>
            Keep building the muscle - Remind myself that intelligence it not defined (fixed mindset).
            It is something you need to perpetually work at and build, just like a muscle (growth mindset).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        I found
        <a target="_blank" href="https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means ">this article </a>
        by Carol Dweck interesting.
        In particular her thoughts about how to foster a good working environment that is committed to growth mindset. \
        “They reward employees for important and useful lessons learned,
        even if a project does not meet its original goals.
        They support collaboration across organizational boundaries rather than competition among employees or units.
        They are committed to the growth of every member,
        not just in words but in deeds, such as broadly available development and advancement opportunities.
        And they continually reinforce growth mindset values with concrete policies.”
    </p>

    <p>
        As you know <span style="font-size: 20px">Everything is a Learnable Skill.</span>
        I will keep reminding myself of neuaroplasticity and Growth Mindset throughout the coming weeks/months/years.
        Reduce the pressure on myself and enjoy the everyday learning journey in becoming a coding butterfly.
    </p>

    <p>Everything is a learnable skill is my virtual journey through the weird and wonderful world of coding,
