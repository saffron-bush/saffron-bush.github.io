    <h2>Family Tree</h2>
      <h3 style="text-align: left">19 February 2022</h3>
  </div>
    <p>
        This week is an important week. 
        This week my new baby niece was born. 
        That's right team, I am now an Aunty ‚ô• ‚ô• ‚ô• üòäüòäüòä
    </p>

    <p> 
        Family is so important. 
        It has got me wondering, will I be a good aunty? 
        What are the family rituals, recipes, and traditions we need to pass onto this new bubba? 
        This week has also been JavaScript week at DevAcademy. 
        Each day I have been trying to wrap my head around different concepts, ideas and meaningful (and perfectly syntaxed) code. 
        Somehow both of these things have somehow become slightly intertwined in my brain.
    </p>

    <p> 
        So what does coding and family have in common? 
        Turns out a few of the characters in your family can help explain different concepts. 
        Plus some of those family rituals and recipes can help explain the dynamics of Javascript. 
    </p>
    <p>
        So how would you explain the difference between CSS, HTML and for that matter Javascript? 
        I am going to assign these languages to different characters in the family. 
    </p> 
      
    <p>
        <span style="color: #82adfc">Grandpa HTML (the boring old fart)</span> 
        First family member you are going to meet is Grandpa HTML. 
        Grandpa HTML is not very mobile, he is not too flash looking but he is the glue that holds the rest of the family together. 
        When he talks, the rest of the family listens. 
        HTML is the very generic script that holds a webpage together, it ain't pretty but it is holding all of the content. 
 </p>
 <p>
    Grandpa HTML (short for Henry Thomas Matthew Little, JK‚Ä¶it stands for HyperText Markup Language. 
    A markup language determines how content is structured. 
    For example, using HTML allows you to define headlines, paragraphs, tables. 
    You use nesting in HTML to put elements within elements. 
    An HTML document isn't a program in and of itself but may contain one, for example in the form of JavaScript Code.
 </p>
    <p>
      <span style="color: #82adfc">Aunty CSS (the art critic)</span> 
      Second family member to meet is Aunty CSS. 
      Aunty CSS is a real looker, she really lights up a room. 
      She has spent a heap on clothes, art and those face creams that claim you will look younger overnight. 
      She does not have much to say about politics or the news, but aunty loves aesthetics. 
      She recently bought a new gold (#FFD700) watch, with a case that had a wide border (border-radius 3px) 
      and with the background colour of light pink (background color - #FFB6C1). 
      The great thing about Aunty CSS is she often lets Grandpa HTML borrow her beautiful possessions. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Aunty CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets. 
        This program lets you add color, style images, add background images and change the layout of your page 
        ‚Äî your site can become an aesthetic masterpiece. 
        Without CSS, the HTML webpage would be drab plain text (yawn, boring grandpa HTML). 
        Additionally, if you build CSS outside of HTML(which is best practice), 
        it makes it easier to maintain sites, share style sheets across multiple pages, and tailor pages to different needs.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span style="color: #82adfc">Uncle JavaScript (the action hero)</span> 
        Then you have Uncle JavaScript, he is suave, sophisticated and a dynamic fellow. 
        Ultimately an adrenaline junkie that loves to perform actions. 
        He is so sophisticated that he can interact with both Grandpa and Aunty and affect their structure or their style.
    </p>

    <p>
        Uncle Javascript determines the behavior on a site. 
        It deals with interactivity and can include engagement from a user. 
        It can include building the ability for: 
        animated graphics, click buttons, autocomplete text suggestions and interactive forms and so much more. 
        It also has the ability to modify HTML and CSS. 
        JavaScript is the magic third wheel to any dynamic website. 
        Once you've created your structure (HTML) and your aesthetic vibe (CSS), JavaScript makes your site dynamic.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span style="color: #82adfc">The DOM (the family tree)</span> 
        Okay, so how to pull all of those together? 
        The Document Object Model (DOM) -  helps you to interact with objects in a document by manipulating elements on the page. 
        Think of interacting with the DOM like a family tree. 
        There is a great great great grandparent that all of the family descended from. 
        Each element on the web page ladders up all the way to the top of the family tree. 
        You can then traverse the DOM through different objects representing different areas of the document.
    </p>

    <p>
        With the DOM, every HTML tag is an object. 
        Nested tags are ‚Äúchildren‚Äù of the enclosing one. 
        The text inside a tag is an object as well. 
        All these objects are accessible using JavaScript. 
        The DOM helps you to interact with these objects in a document by manipulating elements on the page. 
        You can: add, move, remove or change the style properties. 
    </p>


    <p>
        You can use these main formats to manipulate the page through JavaScript:  
    </p>

    <p>
      
      <ul>
        <li> <span style="color: #82adfc">getElementsByTagName</span></li>
        <li> <span style="color: #82adfc">getElementsByClassName</span></li>
        <li> <span style="color: #82adfc">getElementById</span></li>
        <li> <span style="color: #82adfc">getElementsByTagNameNS</span></li>
      </ul>
    
    <p>
        eg  document.getElementById (‚ÄúIdName‚Äù) written within Javascript,
        will return the results of a unique id (a CSS selector) within the HTML doc.
        This will then make it available for you to manipulate within Javascript.
        It is searching the parent: document, then searching a child Id with a specific attribute (IdName).
    </p>

    <p>
        Within Javascript there are a number of commands to help you to pull off a dynamic site. 
        Think of each of these as actions as ways to influence how a site interacts with a user.
    </p>

    <p> 
        <span style="color: #82adfc">Javascript: Control Flow and Loops</span> 
        Control flow allows our program to make decisions about what code is executed and when. 
        It tells the site to either execute or loop over conditions based on whether the answer is true or false.
        Giving the program the ability to work with changing conditions and automate any repetitive tasks. 
        Specifically, a loop allows us to continue executing this task until the conditions equate to false. 
        Ok that sounds complex? How would you explain that in a family ritual?
    </p>

        <P style = "margin-left: 50px"> 
            **Mums and their loops**</P>
        <P style = "margin-left: 50px"> 
            Even though I am far too old, my mum still likes to play the 'mum role'.
            Whenever I head off for a trip, my mum runs through a list of items. 
            It's like she goes into autopilot (it must be a mum thing). 
            She then runs through her loop of items until she runs out of possible items to pack.
            In this case we are going to call our loop packingList. 
            The items she is checking off are toothbrush, phone charge and Kindle. 
            How would I represent that as a for loop in JavaScript?
        </p>

        <P style = "margin-left: 70px">
            let packingList = [ "toothbrush", "phone charger", "Kindle" ];<br>
            for (let i = 0; i < packingList.length; i++) {<br>
            console.log(‚ÄúDo you have:‚Äù + packingList[i]);<br>
        }        
        </p>
        <P style = "margin-left: 50px">
            There are 3 parts to a 'for Loop
        </P>

        <P>
            <ul>
             <li style = "margin-left: 50px"> The initial expression - let 1 = 0> <br>
            It sets the loop control variable to an initial value 
            (because the list is an array, we enter the number [0] to begin the loop at the toothbrush)
        </li>


            <li style = "margin-left: 50px"> The conditional expression - i < packingList.length <br>
            It is an expression that is tested each time the loop repeats. 
            As long as the condition is true, the loop keeps running. 
            (In this case we set the loop to keep continuing until the condition reaches the end of the packingList Length.)</li>
    
        <li style = "margin-left: 50px"> The increment expression - i ++ <br>
            It confirms how the loop control variable is incremented each time the loop repeats successfully.
            (we use ++ to increase to the next item on the list each time it runs a loop) </li>
        </ul>
        </P>

        <P style = "margin-left: 50px">
            And then we console.log for the results
            In this case, the loop would return:
            Do you have: toothbrush
            Do you have: phone charger
            Do you have: Kindle
        </P>

        <p>
        <span style="color: #82adfc">JavaScript: Reference values -  arrays, objects and functions</span>
        My family loves food. 
        If we were to die of one of the 7 deadly sins, it would certainly be gluttony. 
        At breakfast time we usually are already discussing dinner. 
        This is our family ritual but we also have a number of recipes that we are obsessed with as a family. 
        We keep going back to them because they are soooo delicious. 
        I would say my family is great at cooking but so-so at baking. 
        Something we are always trying to perfect is cakes (esp vegan ones). 
        </p>

        <p>
        Arrays, objects and functions all use reference values. 
        But what are reference values and what do they have to do with cooking? 
        Itis all to do with how variables are passed through a statement and how the computer stores them within it's memory. 
        Sounds complicated right? Well let's use a cake analogy to explain how information flows between these items.
        </p>

        <P>
        Sisters are the best and can be super helpful when you need advice, help or information. 
        Let's say your sister walks in the room with a delicious looking piece of cake. 
        You ask your sister, where did you get that piece of cake?
        </P>

        <P>
        **A variable with value type (aka a primitive) would store information like this:**
        </P>
        <P style = "margin-left: 70px">
            My sister would go to the kitchen, collect a slice of cake from the cupboard, and hand-deliver the slice of cake to me. 
            This is passing by value type. 
            Very kind, but it is static information. 
            I am just asking for cake and it appears in my hand. 
            Examples of value types are: strings, numbers, booleans
        </P>

        <P>
        **A variable with a reference type would store information like this:**
        </P>
        <P style = "margin-left: 70px">
            She would say to me "yeah, there's some in a plastic container in the kitchen, middle shelf on the right." 
            she hasn't given me any cake, but told me where the cake slices are located, 
            so now I can go and get one on my own. 
            This is passing by reference. 
            This means I am learning where the variable (cake) is and how to locate it, 
            if I ever want to come back to it or change the location of it. 
        </p>
        <P>
        Unlike value types, a reference type doesn't store its value directly. 
        Instead, it stores the address where the value is being stored. 
        In other words, a reference type contains a pointer to another memory location that holds the data. 
        A reference value allows you to add, change, or delete properties at any time.
        </P>

        <P>
        Now to continue with the cake analogy, objects are the most powerful data type of javascript and are used in almost everything. 
        Functions are objects, Arrays are objects and objects are objects. 
        Objects store data in key value pairs, the keys can allow you to add, 
        change or delete properties at any time and can be accessed in any order. 
        We can either use a dot followed by key name obj.name or a square bracket along with key in a string format obj['name'] to access the value.
        </P>
        <P>
        Eg with a list of cake ingredients, 
        you can pull just one of these key value pairs out. 
        To pull out Chocolate drizzle you could execute the below.
        </P>
        <P style = "margin-left: 70px">
        let cake = { <br>
        dryIngredients : ‚ÄúPacket Mix‚Äù <br>
        wetIngredients : [‚Äúwater‚Äù, ‚ÄúCoconut Oil, Vanilla Essence, ‚ÄúVinegar‚Äù] <br>
        Icing : ‚ÄúChocolate drizzle‚Äù <br>
        }; <br> 
        console.log(cake.icing); 
        </P>

        <p>
        Now you will notice in the above example there is an object (wetIngedients) that has a list of items in it. 
        This list is called an array. 
        JavaScript provides a data type specifically for storing multiple values in a single variable. 
        It is written as a list of values between square brackets, separated by commas. 
        Arrays are zero-indexed: the first element of an array is at index 0, the second is at index 1, and so on ‚Äî 
        and the last element is at the value of the array's length property minus 1.
        </p>

        <p>
        If you wanted to pull out just on the items within the array, 
        let's say Coconut Oil, you would use the index numbers to find this data. 
        So for wetIngredients: water is [0], Coconut Oil is [1], Vanilla Essence is [2], Vinegar is [3]
        </p>

        <P style = "margin-left: 70px">
            let cake = { <br>
                dryIngredients : ‚ÄúPacket Mix‚Äù <br>
                wetIngredients : [‚Äúwater‚Äù, ‚ÄúCoconut Oil, Vanilla Essence, ‚ÄúVinegar‚Äù] <br>
                Icing : ‚ÄúChocolate drizzle‚Äù <br>
                };<br>
                
                console.log(cake.wetIngredients [1])<br>
        </P>

        <p>
        So as you can see an array is different to an object, 
        but it still relies on the structure of an object to return the information that you need. 
        Objects represent a special data type that can store a collection of data (rather than just a single value). 
        Arrays are a special type of variable that can change its variable when needed. 
        It can also be used to store a list of values
        </p>

        <P>
        Now I already mentioned that functions are also an object. 
        But what is a function? A function is  a set of instructions to perform a task and return it. 
        Values can be passed into a function, and the function will return a value. 
        Functions are first-class objects, because they can have properties and methods just like any other object. 
        Functions can be passed by primitive values or by reference values. 
        If the function reassigns a primitive value parameter, the value won't change outside of the function. 
        However, if the function uses an object type parameter, the changes will impact the outside of the function. 
        </P>

        <p>
        Now let's use the ingredients we used before to actually make the cake by using a Function. 
        Below we have the different types of ingredients defined with objects and arrays. 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>To start the function,  we run over the recipe and can see that there are 3 types of ingredients within that cake: dry, wet, Ice. 
                These are names of the arguments to be passed to the function.</li>
            <li>Then we can see the directions we need to take, these are: dry + wet + ice. 
                So for the cake to be made we need to add all of those ingredient types together. </li>
            <li>We have confirmed that once that is done it will return a cake.</li>
            <li>We also need to call the cake with the defined parameters. 
                First we create the name of this complete product = bakedCake, 
                then we define the specific parameters within that BakedCake. 
                Calling the function performs the specified actions with the indicated parameters.
                This means for the ingredients declaration, 
                we are now defining its ingredients as:
                dry ingredients (packet mix) + wet ingredients (water, coconut oil, vanilla essence, vinegar) + Icing (Chocolate Drizzle) </li>
        </ul>
<P style = "margin-left: 70px">
        let dryIngredients = ‚ÄúPacket Mix‚Äù <br>
        let wetIngredients = [‚Äúwater‚Äù, ‚ÄúCoconut Oil, Vanilla Essence, ‚ÄúVinegar‚Äù] <br>
        let Icing = ‚ÄúChocolate drizzle‚Äù <br>
        
        Function ingredients (dry, wet, ice);{ <br>
        Let cake = dry + wet + ice; <br>
        return  cake; <br>
        } <br>
        
        Let bakedCake = ingredients (dry ingredients, wet ingredients, icing);
    </P>

    <p>
        We can now use that function every time we want to bake that cake by using the BakedCake function keyword. 
        We have essentially automated baking a cake. 
        Functions are like a mini program that allow you to: define a block of code, 
        name it and then execute it as many times as you want. 
        This becomes incredibly important when you are building a large document. 
        You can re-use this function keyword again and again to make your code quicker and cleaner. 
        Additionally functions happily take variables from a user and calculate a task quickly. 
        Making the site dynamic for the user.
    </p>

    <p>
        Okay so we have met the family. 
        Listened to mum and baked some cakes. 
        All while explaining some of the fundamentals of Javascript and how it interacts with HTML and CSS. 
        I hope you were able to pick up a few points, but if not that is ok because‚Ä¶ Everything is a Learnable Skill.
    </p>

    <p>
    Something I have learnt this week is that Javascript is not something you get first time round. 
    You have to keep coming back to it to compute more concepts. 
    I think this will be the same for me learning to be an aunty. 
    I wont get it right the first time, but hopefully in 6 months time I will be better. Then in 2 years time I will be great. 
    </p>
