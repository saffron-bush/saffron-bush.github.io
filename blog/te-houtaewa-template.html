      You cannot have too much tea, it really is not possible. 
      My parents are english and drinking tea has always been a part of our lives "cuppa-tea lover?". 
      This important and heavily traditional habit was installed in me from a young age. 
      I know what you thinking, how could drinking tea have anything to do with coding? 
      and in particular anything to do with ID and Class? Well lots, so keep reading</p>
      
    <p> Growing up, I used to drink Eary Gray but now I mostly just drink Green Tea. 
      I drink it when I first get up and keep drinking it until about mid afternoon. 
      Don't tea shame me, but I can get up to 10 pots brewed in one morning.
      I would say green tea is really fueling all my activity throughout the day. 
      It is giving me a pep in my step and giving a day with a nice sunny hue (even when it is raining).</p>
      <p> 
      Okay so what do I do after mid afternoon you ask? I generally only have 1 cup of tea and it is normally a herbal tea.
      Sometimes it is a peppermint, sometimes it is a chamomile and sometimes it is a herbal fusion (ooh fancy). 
      However, I only drink 1 one of those each day. 
      It is just a nice change from all the green tea and it really creates a point of difference in my day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Okay so now we get to the fun part. Imagine my day is HTML code. 
      I am doing a few different activities within my day 
      eg doing schoolwork, making breakfast, walking the dog, checking my emails and finally unwinding at the end of the day.
      Now each of those activities are what we would call an element in html. 
      The first 4 elements are all elements in my day where I need that extra pep (eg a green tea). 
      It is always the same green tea, green tea rolled into jasmine pearls, 
      it is always served in my favourite teapot and of course out of my favourite teacup (the one with a small chip in it). 
      Then at the end of the day, when I want to unwind, I make 1 cup of herbal tea in a different cup. 
      If I was to write this tea ritual in code, I would need to use class and id's.</p> 
      
    <p style="font-size: 18px">
      A class is defined as: 
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 18px">
      An id is defined as: </p>
    <p>
      So my green tea ritual is used multiple times in my day is a class whereas my 1 herbal tea would be an id. 
    </p>
