        <h2>My Commitment of how I will evolve from a Caterpillar to become a Coding Butterfly </h2>
          <h3 style="text-align: left">12 February 2022</h3>
      </div>

      <P> So what do I expect once I become that beautiful coding Butterfly? My immediate plan is to build a grounding in coding. 
          I would really like to feel confident by the end of this course.
          At the moment I am still exploring what is possible and even what I could be good at. 
          Something I really enjoyed in previous roles was thinking about the customer and working with teams like Service Design. 
          In particular fulfilling a holistic solution that is both possible for the business but also good for the customer.</P> 

         <p> I have no background in coding so I think my limitation is my very basic understanding of how coding works. 
          All of this process is incredibly new and anything new can be challenging. 
          I find that the only way for me to learn is to write things down in my own words. 
          This can be really time consuming but it does mean that I create a hectic repo of notes. 
          My strengths would probably be my commitment and my ability to push myself. 
          However, I can push myself too hard at times and not have a good balance between life and work.<p>
          
         <p>By the end of this I would like to see myself being ok with things not being finished or finalised. 
          Working within the sprints or tasks timeframe without feeling stressed. 
          I can struggle if I don't feel a sense of accomplishment.</P>

            My commitment to achieve my goals and hold myself accountable: <p>

           <p style="margin-left:60px">*I commit to being respectful to classmates, facilitators, industry/community reps and myself. 
               This means not becoming frustrated with someone or myself if things are not working out. 
               This also means to be respectful of other peoples time and asking for help only once I have exhausted all possible solutions.</p>  
            
            <p style="margin-left:60px">*I commit to stepping away from the computer and grounding myself when things are getting to me. 
                At times stress can feel like the biggest thing in the world. 
                Remember when you put it into perspective, it is really not as big as you think.</P>
            
            <p style="margin-left:60px">*I commit to seeking help when I need it. 
                When I am feeling overwhelmed I will reach out to family and friends for emotional support. 
                If something technical is not working. 
                I will set a timer of 20mins, if I cannot solve it myself I will reach out to my facilitator Sophia.</P>
            
            <p style="margin-left:60px">*I commit to Weekly check-in's with my facilitator Sophia. This will be a balance of checking in on the week, but also checking in to see how I am coping with the workload and any concepts I am struggling with.</p>
            
            <p style="margin-left:60px">*I commit to this being my number 1 and only priority for the next 4 months. </p>
