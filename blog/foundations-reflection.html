        what happens when you sign up for a gym membership? You are incredibly enthusiastic when you first start. You have the hopes and dreams to become a great athlete. you want to become super fit in 4 weeks. You look around the gym and you think, "Yes, this is the place for me, I will do great here"...
      </p>

      <p>
        Then in your first week you do a little low intensity training to build yourself up. The 2nd week you go to a vinyasa-flow class. You try to keep calm while your balance is off and your strength is non-existent. In your third week you go to a high impact class and think, "This class is going to kill me". The next week your alarm goes off at 6am and you hit snooze til 7am. You push yourself to keep it up and you miss dinner time to only get more exhausted. You look around at all the other gym members and realise you are soo behind. These people are far more capable than you. Maybe you should just give up? Next thing you know, you are 5 weeks in and the whole experience has already felt like a whirlwind. 
      </p> 

      <p>
        Replace the gym with coding and you pretty much have an accurate portrait of my first 5 weeks of DevAcademy. You start off so bright and shiny but pretty quickly those high impact technical questions start to knock your confidence. However, it has been implementing my learnings from core skills that has helped me maintain balance throughout this process. As a result I feel like I have learnt just as much about myself as I have about HTML, CSS and Javascript. Here are three new things I have learnt about myself and ego as a result of the core learning...
      </p>

      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Perfectionism is not great in coding. It's ok to break things and get things wrong. Just start plugging things in. Breaking the system helps you to learn what you shouldn't do. Not knowing everything is ok. It really is about finding information just in time. rather than memorizing everything.</li>

          <li>When that voice tells you your not capable, just acknowledge its sentiment and move on. You can do it. You just need a little more time. Have empathy for yourself that you will overcome the challenge (eventually).</li>

          <li>Using meditation as a tool to slow down and ground myself is key. When I get lost in the tunnel of overwhelm, mindful meditation slows time down. It stops the anxious feelings and helps to focus on what is in front.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        At the very beginning of core we did a values exercise. I always find it hard to talk about myself. However, doing this helped me to recogise some of the strengths, weaknesses and values I already had coming into this course. I realised that I come at this from a very different perspective to anybody else. I have had different experiences and achievements in my life and It gave me the self awareness that I am bound to tackle this differently and that is ok. 
      </p>

      <p>
        What really surprised me was that I thought the core skills would not help me this early on in my coding journey. I found that I spent a lot of time thinking, re-thinking and overthinking my answers to some of the technical questions. Because of this, if we had not put so much emphasis on building on core skills, I may have thought I was not capable on getting this far. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The most challenging moment was learning about how your ego can take over and then seeing it in action. You build awareness that your ego can feed you negative thoughts but next thing you know, your in a pity party for one. I had many moments where I felt like I was not capable. It was the core skills, plus the help of friends,loved ones plus Sophia (my facilitator) that got me back on track. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Thank you DevAcademy for spending so much time teaching core. Having these learnings and skills is such an important aspect to learning to code. It allows you to believe your brain is mailable, that you are capable, it just requires time and effort. So far I have not had a moment where I see a problem and know instantly how to solve it. It can be exhausting to code, because you are in the discomfort zone all the time. Learning those core skills early, gives you a mindset that can cope with that discomfort. 
      </p>

      <p>
        If I was to do these 5 weeks again, I would remind myself daily that learning something new is hard. Have compassion and kindness towards yourself. Don't panic and celebrate the small wins. If you follow the lessons of core learning, you can wake up each day excited about learning something new. Not only about coding but also yourself. Now that I have flexed my core muscles, I am at the next step to build some strong bulging bicep muscles and tackle bootcamp (agghhhh). I will need to keep reminding myself of the above daily (maybe hourly), because... <span style="font-size: 20px">Everything is a Learnable Skill.</span>.
